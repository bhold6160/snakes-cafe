## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is an appliaction to present the user with choices from a food menu and prompt them to make an order, then it will
 print you out a receipt

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
In their terminal, run python snakes_cafe.py. When prompted, enter in the items from the menu that they would like to
order

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
Starts off with us creating lists for each categories and displaying to user using a for-loop. From there, we prompted
the user to place their order.

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
We are not sure if this question applies to what we're doing now.
